How it works:

- If you want to modify an entry, change the "Rom List" and/or "Game index" number and press the "Edit" button.
- If you want to delete an entry, press the Remove button on the entry you want to delete.
- If you want to add a new entry, press the "Add Entry" button, modify "Rom List" and/or "Game index" and press the "Edit" button.

Additional explanation:

"ROM List" This is the number of the emulator list. Explanation at https://github.com/vonmillhausen/sf2000?tab=readme-ov-file#favourites-and-history
"Game Index" This is the number of the game's position, starting with 0 for the first game in the list.
